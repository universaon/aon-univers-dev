      Disability
        </h2><br>
        
        <p>
          The disability benefits provided by Raritan Bay Medical Center work together to help you pay your household expenses if you become disabled and cannot work. These benefits also work with other sources of coverage to replace a certain percentage of your earnings. As a result, the disability payments you receive from our plans will be reduced by any benefits you are eligible to receive from Social Security, Worker’s Compensation, Retirement Benefits or any other disability coverage to which you are entitled. 
        </p><br>
        
        <h5>
          When are you considered disabled?
        </h5><br>
        <p>
          You must be under a doctor’s care in order to be eligible for disability benefits. 
        </p> <hr>
        
        <h4>
          Temporary Disability 
        </h4><br>
        <p>
          Your Temporary Disability coverage through the state of New Jersey provides a weekly benefit that equals 2/3 of your average weekly salary after you have been disabled due to injury or illness for eight calendar days (from the date of injury or illness) to a maximum benefit set by the state of New Jersey each year. Coverage extends for a maximum duration of 26 weeks from the date of injury or illness. To be eligible for this benefit an employee must have had at least 20 weeks of earnings within a 52-week period, which can also include earnings from a previous New Jersey employer. <br><br>
          
          <strong>Please Note: </strong> : The amount of this benefit is subject to change in accordance with New Jersey 
Department of Labor law (www.state.nj.us/labor). To receive the Temporary Disability benefit, you must file a claim within 30 days of your disability date. <br><br>
If you become ill or injured due to a work-related incident you become eligible for Worker’s 
Compensation instead of Temporary Disability. Under Worker’s Compensation an employee would receive up to 70% of their weekly salary to the state maximum after the eighth day of occupational illness or injury. 

        </p>

        <h4>
          
Supplemental Short-Term Disability 

        </h4>
        <br>
        <p>

You can purchase a voluntary plan which provides income replacement of up to 40% of your monthly income ranging from $400 to $5,000. Coverage begins after an employee has been disabled for 14 days and extends for a maximum duration of 6 months. 
<br><br>
If you are interested in enrolling in Supplemental Short-Term Disability, please see the instructions below: 

           </p><br>
        
        
        <h5>
          Your Existing Short Term Disability Plan through Unum:
        </h5>
        <p>
          As a team member who is already enrolled in the Unum Short Term Disability plan, Unum has agreed to reduce the cost of our Short Term Disability rates. This plan will remain on payroll deduction.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>
          Your New Short Term Disability plan from Unum:
        </h5>
        <p>
          During this Open Enrollment, <b>you must meet with a benefits counselor, face-to-face, to sign an updated Short Term Disability form from Unum.</b> You are guaranteed to be approved for the benefit without any pre-existing condition limitations or waiting periods.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>
          Newly Enrolling:
        </h5>
        <p>
          If you are interested in enrolling in Supplemental Short-Term Disability for the first time, please enroll through a Benefits Counselor on-site, over the phone or online through the self-service website. Visit the <a href="../../enrollment/how-to-enroll/index.html" target="blank">How to Enroll</a> page for detailed enrollment instructions. You are guaranteed to be approved for the benefit without any pre-existing condition limitations or waiting periods.

        <h4>
          Long-Term Disability 
        </h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          Raritan Bay Medical Center provides Long-Term Disability coverage through the Unum to all full-time employees scheduled to work 36 hours per week or more. The Long-Term Disability benefit provides employees with a source of income if they become disabled due to a sickness or off-the-job injury for an extended period of time. 
<br><br>
All eligible employees receive 50% of their base salary to a monthly maximum of $10,000 after state-provided Temporary Disability is exhausted. Employees become eligible for this benefit on the first of the month following date of hire. 

        </p><hr>
        <h4>
          Buy-Up Long-Term Disability 
        </h4>
        <p>
          Buy-Up Long Term Disability is grandfathered to existing participants only, meaning the benefit will only be offered to those participants who are currently enrolled in the benefit. Buy-Up Long-Term 
Disability provides the basic benefit provided by Raritan Bay Medical Center (50%) but it will be taxed based on the value of the coverage using an imputed income. The full 50% benefit will be received tax free should you become disabled and be unable to work after the six-month waiting period. 

<b>Please Note:</b> New participants CANNOT enroll in the Buy-Up Long-Term Disability benefit.
