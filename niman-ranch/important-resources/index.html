           Medicare Part D
        </h4><br>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
        <P>
Please read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find
it. This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage with Perdue and prescription drug coverage available for people with Medicare. It also explains the options you have under Medicare Part(prescription drug coverage) and can help you decide whether or not you want to enroll. At the end of this notice is information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage. </P><br>
          <ul class='listn'>
            <li> Medicare Part D became available in 2006 to everyone
with Medicare through Medicare prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage Plans that offer prescription drug coverage. All Medicare prescription drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some
plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium.</li><br>
            <li>Perdue’s prescription drug plan, administered by Express
Scripts, is considered “creditable coverage”. Creditable coverage means that your current plan’s prescription drug coverage is as good as or better than Medicare Part D coverage.</li>
          </ul><br> <P>
            Because your existing coverage is as good as or better than standard Medicare Part D, you can keep this coverage and not pay extra if you later decide to enroll in Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. Individuals can enroll in a Medicare Part D when they first become eligible for Medicare and each year from October 15th through December 7th. Beneficiaries leaving employer/ union coverage may be eligible for a two month Special Enrollment Period to sign up for a Medicare Part D. You should compare your current coverage, including which drugs are covered, with the coverage and cost of the plans offering Medicare Part D in your area. You should also know that if you drop or lose your coverage with Perdue and don’t enroll in Medicare Part D after your current coverage ends, you may pay more (a penalty) to enroll in Medicare Part D later. If you go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that’s at least as good as Medicare Part D, your monthly premium will go up at least 1% per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without coverage, your premium will always be at least 19% higher than what many other people pay. You’ll have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare Part D. In addition, you may have to wait until the following October to enroll.<br><br>
          
          If you decide to join a Medicare drug plan, your current Perdue
coverage will not be affected. You can keep your coverage through Perdue and this plan will coordinate with your Part D coverage.<br><br>
           
          
            </P>

More detailed information about Medicare plans that offer prescription drug coverage is in the “Medicare &amp; You” handbook. You’ll get a copy of the handbook in the mail every year from Medicare. You may also be contacted
directly by Medicare prescription drug plans. For more information about Medicare Part D:  </p>

              For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying
for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is available.<br><br>
             <b> Information about this extra help is available from the Social Security Administration (SSA) online at www.socialsecurity.gov, or you call them at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778).<br><br>
              Remember: Keep this Creditable Coverage notice. If you decide to join one of the Medicare drug plans, you may be required to provide a copy of this notice when you join to show whether or not you have maintained creditable coverage and, therefore,
                whether or not you are required to pay a higher premium (a penalty).</b>

          Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act:
        </h4><br>
        <P>
          The Women’s Health and Cancer Rights of 1998 was enacted on
October 21, 1998. It provides certain protection for breast cancer patients who elect breast reconstruction in connection with a mastectomy. Specifically, the act requires that health plans cover post-mastectomy reconstructive breast surgery if they provide medical and surgical coverage for mastectomies. Coverage must be provided for (1) reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed; (2) surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; and (3) prostheses and physical complications of all stages of mastectomy, including lymph edema. The benefits required under the Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act must be provided in a manner determined by the attending physician in consultation with the patient. These benefits are subject to the health plan’s regular deductibles and co-payments. This notice will be provided annually.

          Access to Obstetric or Gynecological Care
        </h4><br>
        <P>
          You do not need prior authorization from Perdue or from any
other person (including a primary care provider) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional may, however, be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact your HR Department.

          Childrens health Insurance Plan (CHIP)
        </h4><br>

If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and you’re eligible for health coverage from your employer, your state may have a premium assistance program that can help pay for coverage, using funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs. If you or your children aren’t eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you won’t be eligible for these premium assistance programs but you may be able to buy individual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. For more information, visit <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" target="blank">www.healthcare.gov</a>.<br><br>
                  If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a State listed <a href="../../app_themes/blankcanvas/perdue2016/docs/chipmodelnotice.pdf" target="blank">here</a>, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available.<br><br>
                     If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or<a href="https://www.insurekidsnow.gov/" target="blank"> www.insurekidsnow.gov</a> to find out how to apply.
                  </p>

                <p>
                
                  
If you qualify, ask your state if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan. If you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as eligible under your employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you aren’t already enrolled. This is called a “special enrollment” opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance. If you have questions about enrolling in your employer plan, contact the Department of Labor at <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ebsa/contactEBSA/consumerassistance.html" target="blank"> www.askebsa.dol.gov</a> or call 1-866-444-EBSA (3272).                </p>
