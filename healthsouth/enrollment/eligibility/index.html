        <h2>
    Eligibility
        </h2>
         <p>
            Generally, the benefit plan eligibility includes full-time employees and part-time benefit eligible employees. There are certain other
plans described here that other employee designations may elect.<br><br>
           
New employees or those just becoming eligible must enroll
immediately upon becoming eligible. Changes to the enrollment
may be made within the first 31 days. Any enrollments
or changes beyond the initial 31 days will not be accepted – if
you have not elected coverage, you will have no coverage for the
remainder of the year.
        </p>
      <br>
        
        <h4>
         When Coverage Begins
        </h4>
        <p>
          Coverage will be effective on the date of eligibility (hire date/change of status date). Changes to the initial enrollment can
be made within the first 31 days of eligibility. The effective date
for coverage changes made within the first 31 days of eligibility
is the date the form is signed by the employee.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          When Coverage Ends
        </h4>
        <p>
          Coverage will end on the date an employee terminates employment,
the date an employee changes to a non-benefit eligible
class or when an employee goes out on a leave of absence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          Eligible Members
        </h4>
        <p>
          Eligible members that you may include in your health insurance
coverage are listed below. You must provide proper documentation
for each member within two weeks of the coverage effective
date (see Dependent Eligibility Verification topic on the <a href="../../benefits/medical-prescription/index.html" target="blank">Medical page</a>). Without proper documentation, your eligible members
will not be covered.
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          	<li>Your legal spouse</li>
            <li>Your same or opposite sex domestic partner, provided he or
she meets the domestic partner requirements</li>
            <li>An unmarried or married child* up to age 26</li>
            <li>An unmarried, incapacitated child* who is age 26 and over; is
not able to support himself; and depends on you for support,
if the incapacity occurred before age 26</li>
          <br>
          <p>
            *A child is defined as your natural child, stepchild, legally
adopted child, child placed for adoption, or other child for whom
the employee has permanent legal custody.
          </p>
        </ul>
         <br>
        
        <h4>
          Domestic Partners/Same-Sex Spouses
        </h4>
        <p>
          For your domestic partner to be covered under the Medical Plan
(including the Prescription Drug Program) and the Dental and
Vision Programs, you and your domestic partner must:
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          <li>Consider each other life partners</li>
          <Li>Both be age 18 or older</Li>
          <li>Not be blood related</li>
          <li>Have lived together for at least 12 months</li>
          <Li>Share the same permanent address and provide your driver’s
licenses listing the common address</Li>
          <li>Have joint responsibility for each other’s welfare and be
mentally competent</li>
          <li>Not be legally married to or in a domestic partnership with
anyone else</li>
          <li>Not have had another domestic partner within the past six months</li>
          <li>Share necessities of life and financial interdependence</li>          
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
          Domestic Partners must complete the “Affidavit Declaring
Domestic Partnership Status” and submit at least two of the
following documents:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="listc">
          
          <li>A joint bank account, credit account or loan</li>
          <li>Joint vehicle ownership</li>
          <li>Joint ownership, mortgage or lease of a residence</li>
          <li>Evidence of common household expenses, such as utilities
or phone</li>
          <li>Wills naming each other as executor and/or beneficiary</li>
          <li>Granting each other power of attorney</li>
          <li>Designating each other as a beneficiary under a retirement
benefit account or evidence of other joint financial
responsibility.</li>          
        </ul>
        <br>
        
        <p>
          You must submit a Domestic Partner Affidavit with the specified
documentation above to obtain coverage.<br><br>
          
Unless your domestic partner qualifies as a “dependent” under
the Internal Revenue Code, you may be treated as receiving
“imputed income” for federal income tax purposes with
respect to the benefits provided to your domestic partner.
Imputed income is the difference between the value of the
benefit provided to your domestic partner and the amount that
you have paid for that benefit. You must pay federal income
taxes (including Social Security tax and Medicare tax) on your
imputed income. Similar treatment may apply for state and local
income tax purposes, to the extent applicable. For more information
on federal, state or local taxation of domestic partner
or same-sex spouse benefits, please contact your tax advisor.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h4>
          Qualifying Event Changes
        </h4>
        <p>
          Changes to benefit elections during the year are permitted only
with a “qualifying event.” A qualifying event includes:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="listc">
          
          <li>Marriage</li>
          <li>Divorce/legal separation or termination of domestic partner
status</li>
          <li>Addition of newborn</li>
          <li>Death of dependent</li>
          <li>Court ordered coverage for dependent child only</li>
          <li>Dependent child has lost coverage</li>
          <li>Significant change in health coverage offered to employee and dependent</li>
          <li>Spouse/domestic partner commencement or termination
of employment</li>
          <li>Change in eligibility of employee or spouse</li>
          <li>Unpaid leave of absence by employee or spouse</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>
          A change in coverage based on one of the reasons above must be
made within 31 days of the event. <!--The form needed to complete
the change is provided on the Benefits homepage.-->
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>If Approved, When the Qualifying Event Change Is Effective</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The effective date of the coverage change will be the date the
employee requests the change (based on the date the form is
signed). Changes due to marriage, divorce, birth or adoption
are effective the date of the actual qualifying event.
        </p>
