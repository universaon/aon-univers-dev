          College Savings (529 Plan)
        </h3>
        <p>
         CollegeBound 529, managed by Ascensus College Savings, is an industry leader in administering 529 college savings plans.  The CollegeBound 529 plan enables participants to use after-tax money to fund a college savings account for a child.”
        </p><br>
        <h4>
          High Contribution Limits and No Income Limits
        </h4>
        <p>
          The college savings fund can grow to a total of $301,550 for
each beneficiary.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          Tax Benefits
        </h4>
        <p>
          Funds invested in these accounts grow free from federal tax.
Furthermore, withdrawals are federal-income tax free when
used to pay for qualified higher education expenses such as
tuition, room and board, books and supplies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          Changing Beneficiaries
        </h4>
        <p>
          The beneficiary can be changed to another member of the
beneficiary’s family at any time without penalty.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          Special Gift and Estate Tax Treatment
        </h4>
        <p>
          The CollegeBound 529 also allows for a special gift tax exclusion. You may contribute up to $55,000 per beneficiary in a single
year ($110,000 for married couples) without triggering federal
gift tax consequences.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          Withdrawals
        </h4>
        <p>
          Employees can make withdrawals from the account at any time.
Withdrawals used for qualified higher learning expenses are
not taxable. If the withdrawn funds are not used for qualified
expenses, the withdrawal is treated as ordinary income for tax
purposes and the IRS applies a 10% penalty.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          Investments
        </h4>

allocation portfolios. An age-based and risk-based portfolio is
