          Purchasing Power
        </h3>
        <p>
          Purchasing Power is the premier program that makes it possible
for full- and part-time employees to buy name brand computers,
electronics and home appliances through payroll deduction.
Purchasing Power is not a discount program—it’s a safe, responsible
alternative to credit card or manufacturer financing. Cash
purchasing is always less expensive than extended-payment
purchasing. Purchasing Power lets you reserve your credit for
other things, like emergencies. Unlike traditional financing,
Purchasing Power sets a fixed price for its products and never
adds finance or interest charges. That fixed price is divided into
26 equal payments, which will come out of your paycheck every
pay period for one year—and then you’re done. Your product
will be delivered within 1 - 3 weeks of placing your order. Payroll
deduction payments are easy, convenient and safe.

          Group Legal Plan
        </h3>
        <p>
          HealthSouth offers group legal services through MetLaw,
provided by Hyatt Legal Plans, to full-time and part-time employees.
The plan provides fully covered legal advice and assistance for
most personal legal matters (employment/business related
matters and divorce are excluded from coverage) for the
employee, spouse/domestic partner and dependents.<br><br>
          
Everyone needs legal guidance from time to time. From common
legal matters such as wills, estate and financial matters, to
defense of civil lawsuits, Hyatt Legal Plans provide comprehensive
assistance. With a Hyatt Legal Plan, you can meet anytime
with local plan attorneys to take care of legal matters.
          <br><br>
Employees select from a nationwide network of attorneys or
any attorney of their own choice. In-network, there are no claim
forms required; attorney’s fees for covered services are fully
covered by the plan. Out-of-network, you submit a claim form
to Hyatt and are reimbursed according to a set fee schedule.
          <br><br>
Hyatt’s Legal Plan is like having an attorney on retainer. There
are no waiting periods, copays or hour limits, and there are no
limits to the number of times per year you can use the plan.<br><br>
          
This service is $7.88 per paycheck.

Awards. Some examples of points that may be rewarded to employees for <i>Stepping Up</i> might include providing our patients with an excellent experience and a positive outcome; fostering
an environment of working together; giving back to the community;
or participating in the company’s Wellness programs.<br><br>
          
          Employees may let leadership know when co-workers go above
and beyond by “Nominating a Colleague” on the <a href="https://healthsouth.werecognize.com/signin" target="blank">HealthSouth.WeRecognize.com</a> website. The website also allows employees
to recognize fellow employees with non-points valued
E-certificates to celebrate a birthday, wedding, new baby, or
professional accomplishments.<br><br>
          
          
Points earned may be redeemed for merchandise, travel, event
tickets and activities. Visit the <a href="https://healthsouth.werecognize.com/signin" target="blank">HealthSouth.WeRecognize.com</a> website to view the Rewards Gallery and learn how to earn
points through the programs currently in place. Any points you
earn roll over from year to year, allowing you to accumulate
total points towards items on your wish list.<br><br>
          
The Internal Revenue Service considers employee recognition
awards as income. As such, you will be taxed on the recognition
points as they are issued and once awarded, the taxes will be
reflected on your paystub after the reporting period.<br><br>
          
If you terminate employment with HealthSouth, you will be able
to redeem your points within 90 days of your last day of employment.
If you have not redeemed your points by that date, a gift
card for the equivalent amount of the points will be mailed to
your home address.
