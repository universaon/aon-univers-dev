       Medical And Prescription Drug Plans

        <p>
          Full-time and part-time benefit eligible employees have two
medical plan options, Core and Core Plus, to choose from
through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. The prescription drug
coverage is included in each of the medical plan options. The premiums
for the medical plan and prescription drug coverage appear
as one deduction amount on the paycheck. The rates are listed
in the tables below.

          Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Health Assessment
        </h4>
        
          <p>
          Participants in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Medical Plan are
encouraged to register on the website at <a href="http://www.bcbstx.com/" target="blank">www.bcbstx.com</a> to
take advantage of online services available 24/7. Some of the
services available include finding a participating provider, viewing
claims, and ordering replacement I.D. cards.
<br><br>
            
            Participants also have access to Blue Cross’s <a href="http://wellontarget.com" target="blank">wellontarget.com</a>
website which contains an abundance of health and wellness tools, including the Health Assessment. This online health
assessment tool provides medical plan participants with an
opportunity to answer basic questions and receive an overall
health score. The health score indicates how healthy a current
lifestyle is and pinpoints areas that may have room for
improvement. Individual results are confidential and reported
back only to the participant – not to HealthSouth or anyone else.
Once a participant completes the assessment, additional online
tools designed to improve the health score are available.
          </p>
             <br>
        
        <h4>
          Take the Health Assessment Survey and Save Money
        </h4>
			<p>
      Because your health awareness is so important, new medical
plan participants who complete their online Health Assessment
will receive a $10 per paycheck discount on their HealthSouth
medical plan premiums through the end of the current plan
year. If you have a spouse/domestic partner on your medical coverage,
he/she will need to complete the online Health Assessment
in order to qualify for the $10 per paycheck discount. (Note: The
premium reduction begins on the first full paycheck following the
completion of the Health Assessment.)
      	    </p><br>
       
        <h4>
          The Health Assessment and Well On Target
        </h4>
        
        
        <p>
          Once you and your spouse/domestic partner (if applicable) have
taken the Health Assessment, you have taken an important step
in becoming aware that the choices you make have an impact
on your health and well-being. The feedback you receive from
your Health Assessment can be your guide to improving your
health. Check out the suggested resources on the <a href="http://wellontarget.com/" target="blank">Well On Target</a> website that provide guidance on improving your health, starting
or improving an exercise program or making healthy food
choices for you and your family. The Health Assessment is a tool for you and
your spouse/domestic partner (if applicable) to use and update.
As you have physician visits – update the Health Assessment with the current
blood pressure readings or cholesterol levels. When you increase
your daily exercise program – record that in the Health Assessment. Each step
you take may improve your overall score. Visit <a href="http://wellontarget.com/" target="blank">wellontarget.com</a> and use the resources – become more active, make healthy food
choices and be healthy.<br><br>

          Prescription Drug Coverage
        </h4>
        <p>
          Prescription drug coverage through Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Texas is included with the medical plan election. More than
53,000 pharmacies (most major chain and independent drug
stores) participate nationwide.
        </p><br>
        <h4>
          Retail Program
        </h4>
        <p>
          Under the Prescription Program, you will need to present
your I.D. card when visiting a participating pharmacy. You
will also be required to pay a copay for each drug purchase.
After the appropriate copay has been paid, your pharmacy will
electronically file your claim for you and Blue Cross will pay the
remaining balance.

          Special Beginnings is a prenatal wellness program that helps
ensure you or your spouse/domestic partner and baby receive
the best possible health care during pregnancy. This program is
administered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. As a Blue
Cross member, participation in Special Beginnings is available to
you or your spouse/domestic partner as part of your health plan.
There is no additional charge for participation in this special
program. The program is administered by registered nurses with
experience in prenatal care, labor and delivery, and newborn
care. You or your spouse/domestic partner will receive special
attention throughout the pregnancy, and can enjoy the fact that
Special Beginnings nurses are available to answer questions and
offer support. Useful gifts that educate and support healthy
habits are provided as part of Special Beginnings. These gifts
underscore the importance of proper prenatal care in simple,
easy-to-understand terms and help you understand the changes
and challenges that accompany pregnancy.

cover in the medical and dental plans within two weeks of the
coverage effective date. The required documentation for your
