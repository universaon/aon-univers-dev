          Short-term Disability Plans
        </h4>
        <p>
          The Short-Term Disability (STD) plans are voluntary plans that
provide partial income replacement for full-time employees who
are unable to work due to illness, pregnancy or injury. These
plans are not offered to employees in states where disability
coverage is provided or mandated by the state (CA, HI, NJ, NY,
PR or RI).
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p>
          <b>Option 1: 60% STD Benefit Plan &#8212;
 14-Day Waiting Period</b><br>
This plan provides you with a weekly benefit amount equal to
60% of your base weekly earnings up to a maximum of $500
per week. The benefit waiting period is 14 calendar days and
the maximum benefit duration is 24 weeks. The premiums are
calculated based on your age and base monthly salary. Please
refer to the premium chart for the approximate
monthly cost.
          <br><br>
          <b>Option 2: 50% STD Benefit Plan &#8212;
 30-Day Waiting Period</b><br>
This plan provides you with a weekly benefit amount equal to
50% of your base weekly earnings up to a maximum of $500
per week. The benefit waiting period is 30 calendar days and
the maximum benefit duration is 22 weeks. The premiums are
calculated based on your age and base monthly salary. Please
refer to the premium chart for the approximate
monthly cost.

        <p>
          To enroll, complete the Short-Term Disability section of the
Benefits Enrollment form within 31 days of your hire date or
change of status to full-time. Enrollment into the plan beyond
the initial 31 days will not be accepted. The next opportunity to

and will require medical evidence of insurability satisfactory
to Unum.

          Enrollment into the Short-Term Disability plans beyond the initial
31 days will not be accepted. The next opportunity to apply for this

          Reporting a Disability Claim
        </h4>
        <p>
          The benefit waiting or elimination period to receive disability benefits depends on the option you elect. For Option 1, there is a 14-day
waiting period, and for Option 2 there is a 30-day waiting period.
          <br><br>
Call Unum’s Claim Intake at 800-723-8500 to file a disability claim. For a scheduled or planned disability (due to surgery or pregnancy),
you may call up to 2 weeks in advance of your disability. The HealthSouth Control/Group number is 467565.
          <br><br>
          
Paid Time Off (PTO) may be used during the applicable 14- or 30-calendar day waiting period. However, you cannot receive both
PTO and disability payments at the same time during the disability benefit period.

          Long-Term Disability Insurance Plans
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Long-Term Disability (LTD) plans provide partial income
replacement for full-time employees who are unable to work
due to illness or injury. Coverage in the Company provided plan
is effective the date of your six-month anniversary if you have
continued to meet the eligibility requirements.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          Pre-Existing Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>
          During the first 12 months of coverage, no long-term disability
benefits will be paid for a disability that is due to a pre-existing
condition. A pre-existing condition is an injury or illness for
which you received medical treatment, consultation or diagnostic
measures, prescribed drugs or medications, or for which you
followed treatment recommendations during the three months
prior to your effective date of coverage. See the plan booklet for
additional information on coverage, limitations and exclusions.
