    Retirement Invetment Plan &#8212; 401(k) and HealthSouth Employee Stock Purchase Plan

        <h3>
          Retirement Investment Plan &#8212;

 401(k)
          
        </h3>
        <p>
         Take full advantage of the company matching contribution for
your 401(k). HealthSouth’s match is 50% of the first 6% of pay
contributed to the plan.<br><br>
          
The HealthSouth Retirement Investment Plan is a plan qualified
by the IRS and operating under Department of Labor regulations.
The plan allows employees to contribute up to 100% of
their pay on a pre-tax basis into their individual retirement
accounts subject to the normal maximum limits set by the IRS.
If you will turn 50 or older during the plan year, you are eligible to make an additional pre-tax “catch-up contribution.”
          
          
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h4>
          Benefit
        </h4>
        <p>
          Employees direct the investment of their contributions and the
company matching amounts. Participants receive quarterly
statements outlining account activity and balances. Online
access is also available for on-demand account review and
changes using the <a href="https://workplace.schwab.com/public/workplace/retirement-planning" target="blank">workplace.schwab.com</a> site. The earnings
in the plan accumulate tax-deferred until retirement or withdrawal.
The HealthSouth plan also features a loan provision,
which allows participants to borrow their own money without
an IRS penalty and repay themselves through payroll deduction.
        </p><br>
        <h4>
          Roth Option
        </h4>
        <p>
          Your plan includes a Roth option. If you decide to make Roth
contributions, they will be deducted from your paycheck after
taxes. Your contributions and earnings will grow tax-free, and
you will not pay taxes on the money when it’s withdrawn — provided that any distribution from the plan account occurs
at least five years following the year you make your first Roth
contribution, and you have reached age 59½ or have become
disabled. If you die, your beneficiary will not owe taxes on the
plan account balance either. Federal law limits the dollars you can contribute every year.</p><br>
          <h4>
            Company Match
        </h4>
        <p>
          A 50% matching contribution is applied to the first 6% of salary
deferred into the plan. In other words, you will receive 50 cents
on every dollar that you contribute up to 6% of your compensation
each payday. Any contributions greater than 6% of an
employee’s salary are not matched. Any money you contribute
into the plan is always 100% vested, but a vesting schedule
does apply to the HealthSouth company match. The vesting
schedule for ownership of the company match is three years
of HealthSouth service. Once you have completed three years
of service in which you work at least 1,000 hours in an eligible
class with HealthSouth, you will become 100% vested in the
company match.

        <h4>
          Investment Advice
        </h4>
        <p>

help you get started saving for retirement or fine tune your
investment selections to meet your retirement goals. You can
access the service by calling Schwab Participant Services at

        <h4>
          Rollovers

        <p>
          The plan accepts rollovers from other qualified plans at any time.

(ies), so be sure to make your designations when you enroll.

          HealthSouth Employee Stock Purchase Plan
        </h3>
        <p>
          The HealthSouth Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), administered
by UBS Financial Services, allows employees to purchase
HealthSouth common stock through payroll deduction. This is a
voluntary plan. HealthSouth pays the brokerage fees associated
with the purchase of the stock.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
          How the Plan Works

paycheck each pay period. Enroll in the plan by visiting the
UBS One Source website (instructions are below) or by calling
customer service at 844-402-1854. Your authorized deductions
will be deducted after tax from your paycheck each pay period
during the offering period (calendar month) and deposited into
your UBS Financial Services brokerage account. At the close of
each offering period, or calendar month, UBS Financial Services
will deliver your HealthSouth shares to your brokerage account.
You can view the number of shares purchased for you by accessing
your account on the UBS One Source website <a href="https://onesource.ubs.com/CEFSWebApp/callpage.do?bookCode=HLS&amp;page=login_header_new" target="blank">(www.ubs.
