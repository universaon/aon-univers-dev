        <p>
          <i>A trip to the hospital can be stressful…and so can the bills.</i><br><br>
Health insurance isn’t always enough to cover all the expenses associated with a hospital stay. Hospital Indemnity Insurance works as a supplement to your medical coverage, paying benefits that can help offset out-of-pocket expenses.
<br><br>
The plan pays a lump sum benefit directly to you if you or a covered family member is admitted to the hospital for a covered accident or sickness. You can use this benefit any way you choose to cover expenses the medical plan may not cover, such as coinsurance and deductibles.

          <i>The out-of-pocket costs of a serious illness can be catastrophic, even with medical insurance.</i> <br><br>
Critical Illness Insurance helps provide financial protection in the event of a covered serious illness. The policy pays a lump sum benefit directly to you if you are diagnosed with a covered condition. You can use this benefit any way you choose &#8212; to cover deductibles and coinsurance, to pay expenses your family incurs to be by your side, or simply to replace lost earnings from being out of work. You choose the benefit amount when you enroll.

<i>Can your family maintain their lifestyle without you? Whole Life Insurance helps ensure they can. </i>	<br><br>

Whole (Permanent) Life Insurance is designed to pay a death benefit to your beneficiaries if you pass away. Unlike term life insurance, permanent life insurance doesn’t have an expiration date (or term). Since the coverage doesn’t expire, your premiums will stay the same for as long as you hold the policy.

           <li>Whole Life Insurance is voluntary, which means you can purchase the precise amount of coverage that is right for your needs.</li>
           <Li>The benefit is guaranteed issue when first offered, so no physical exams are required to apply for coverage up to a certain amount.</Li>
           <li>Coverage is portable – you can take your policy with you if you change jobs or retire.</li>
