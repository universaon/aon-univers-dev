                    <p>The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, includes both the individual mandate and the employer mandate. The individual mandate requires that most Americans have qualifying healthcare coverage or potentially face a fine. The employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to their full-time employees or potentially face a fine. Much like the Form W-2 is used to determine whether or not you owe taxes, the IRS will use the information reported from your Form 1095-C to determine whether you (or your employer) may have to pay a fine for failing to comply with the Affordable Care Act. </p>
<p>
The Form 1095-C contains important information about the healthcare coverage offered or provided to you by your employer. Information from the form may be referenced when filing your tax return and/or to help determine your eligibility for a premium tax credit. Think of the form as your “proof of insurance” for the IRS. </p>
<p>
If you or a family member enrolled in healthcare coverage at any time in 2015, you will receive a Form 1095 from the entity that provided the coverage. For example, if you were determined to be a full-time employee or were enrolled in coverage through your employer, you will receive a 1095-C from your employer.

Your decision between these two plan options is based on whether you wish to have a lower premium in exchange for a higher deductible/out-of-pocket maximum (Silver option), or pay a higher premium and have a lower deductible/out-of-pocket maximum (Gold option).

                    <p>An HSA is an Associate-owned savings account available to those enrolled in a qualified Consumer Driven Health Plan (CDHP). HSAs are designed to help you save for qualified medical and retiree health expenses, and can be used to pay for current and future qualified medical expenses for certain eligible individuals including you, your spouse, and your tax dependents. All medical plans offered by HBC are qualified CDHPs. You cannot open an HSA without being enrolled in such a plan.  </p>

                    <p>Yes.  HBC’s Associate per-pay deductions for HSA contributions are structured so your annual contribution will not exceed the IRS contribution limits. You may, however, elect to override these per-pay limits and make payroll-deducted HSA contributions that are in excess of the per-pay limits. <strong> If you choose to make such higher contributions, you will be responsible to make certain your contributions do not exceed the IRS-imposed limits.</strong> You may also make additional contributions directly to your account custodian, HSA Bank. Direct contributions will be tax-deductible (up to IRS limits) on your federal tax return. Please note that HBC and its benefit partners will <strong>not</strong> be responsible if you make excess HSA contributions during the year, so please plan your HSA contributions accordingly.

For most individuals this means you will no longer be eligible when you turn 65. You lose eligibility as of the first day of the month you turn 65. For example, if you turn 65 on July 21, you are no longer eligible to contribute to your HSA as of July 1. Your maximum contribution for that year is the sum of 1/12 of your applicable annual limit (remember to include the catch-up amount in the federal limit) times the number of months you were eligible.

                    <p>Your HSA can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses defined by the IRS (Publication 502). Keep in mind that the qualified medical expenses can change from time to time and may be different than expenses eligible under HBC’s Medical Plan. HSA dollars used for non-qualified expenses are subject to tax and penalties – so be careful about ensuring your HSA is used for allowable expenses only. It is very important that you maintain receipts for ALL expenses you apply to your account. In the event of a tax audit – you will be required to show proof of qualified medical expenses.  Common allowable expenses include:
  </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Doctor's office visits</li>

                    <p>Yes. To open an HSA investment account, you need to transfer a minimum of $2,000 from your cash account to the investment account. After the initial transfer of $2,000, this threshold does not need to be maintained in the investment account. In addition, there is no minimum that needs to be maintained in your cash account once you’ve opened the investment account. </p>

The biometric screening can be done at one of numerous onsite screening events that HBC will host early in 2016, or it can be done at your physician’s office or at a lab. Both the HRA and the biometric screening will be at no cost to Associates.
