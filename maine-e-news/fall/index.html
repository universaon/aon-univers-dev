              <br> <br><br>

              
                
                <p>
                
Now that fall has arrived and the temperature has begun to drop, some may be
making the mistake of putting their running shoes away until next summer. Did
you know your body burns more calories during the colder weather? Your body
uses more energy to generate heat, thus shedding even more calories than it would during warmer temperatures due to your metabolic rate increasing to warm
your body.<br><br>
                  
                  There are also delicious, healthy foods available in the fall that we miss out on during the summer: root vegetables and crisp fruits — the perfect comfort foods to enjoy as the weather begins to cool..<br><br>

<b>SIMPLE EVERYDAY EXERCISES</b><br><br>
                  
<b>Yard Work–</b> Raking the yard is a lot
like doing the laundry: there is always
more coming the next day. This is an
easy, productive exercise that keeps
your body moving more than it does
when using a leaf blower. The average
150 pound person will burn about 235
calories in 45 minutes of leaf-raking.
<br><br>
                  
<b>Go for a walk or jog –</b> Be quick and
brisk. You burn fewer calories if you
walk at the strolling rate of a 30-minute
mile, so challenge yourself to a faster
pace. Also seek trails with inclines, dips
or some sort of variations. This will
burn twice the amount of calories than
walking on a flat route.
              <br><br>    
<b>Enjoy the weather –</b> Before the snow
hits the ground, take advantage of the
crisp, cool weather. Instead of sitting
in the break room, try going for a walk
during your lunch break. If you are at
soccer practice waiting for your children
to be done, go for a walk, bring another
parent with you as you walk.<br><br>

<b>GET MOVING, GET STARTED</b>
Let’s not forget to do the one thing
we encourage our kids to constantly
do: Go outside. There are amazing
benefits you can only receive during
the cooler weather, so open up that
door and take your first step.   <br><br>
                  
<b>FALL FOODS WITH BENEFITS</b>

            <center> <img src="../../app_themes/blankcanvas/maineenews/images/sodium.png" class="img-responsive" style=max-height:400px;></center>

             <br><br>
<p><b>ON AVERAGE, AMERICAN ADULTS EAT MORE THAN 3, 400
MILLIGRAMS OF SODIUM DAILY,</b> which is more than double
the American Heart Association’s recommended limit of
1,500 mg. Where does the sodium we eat come from?
  
  <br><br>
You may be surprised to learn that only about 10 percent
comes from home cooked meals and 25 percent from
restaurants. The remaining 65 percent accumulates from
processed foods you would find at the grocery store such
as frozen pizzas or canned soup. One cup of chicken noodle
soup can have up to 940 mg of sodium.
  
  <br><br>
Too much sodium can increase your risk for high blood
pressure, which in turn can lead to heart disease and
stroke. Learning to read and understand food labels can
help you make healthier choices, and practice portion
control.
  <br><br>
Just a reminder, that two nutritional counseling visits are
provided per 12 months at no cost with an in-network
provider under the State of Maine Point of Service health
insurance plan. No diagnosis required (e.g. obesity) and
visit can be with a registered dietician.

			<b>WHAT IS OBESITY COSTING YOU?</b><br><br>
Currently in the United States, obesity
proves to be one of the biggest drivers
of preventable chronic diseases and
healthcare costs. Estimates range from
$147 billion to nearly $210 billion per
year. It also has a direct impact on the
State of Maine health plan and the
premiums you pay.
               
               <br><br>
Setting the right goals is an important
first step to losing and maintaining
weight. Even a small weight loss (just
5-10 percent of your current weight) will
help to lower your risk of developing
weight-related diseases.<br><br>
               <b>BREAKDOWN OF THE COSTS</b><br><br>
               
• Obese adults spend 42 percent more on
direct healthcare costs than adults who
are a healthy weight.<br><br>
  • Per capita healthcare costs for severely
or morbidly obese adults (BMI >40) are 81
percent higher than for healthy weight adults.
In 2000, around $11 billion was spent on
medical expenditures for morbidly obese U.S.
adults.<br><br>
• Moderately obese (BMI between 30 and 35)
individuals are more than twice as likely as
healthy weight individuals to be prescribed
prescription pharmaceuticals to manage
medical conditions.<br><br>
• Costs for patients presenting at emergency
rooms with chest pains are 41 percent higher
for severely obese patients, 28 percent higher
for obese patients and 22 percent higher for
overweight patients than for healthy- weight
patients.<br><br>

  <b>HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT
&amp; MAINTAIN IT</b>
  <br><br>
  Changing the way you approach weight loss can help you
be more successful at losing it. Most people who try to lose
weight focus on one thing: weight loss. However if you set
goals, begin to eat healthy foods, become more physically
active, and learn how to change behaviors, then you may
be more successful at losing weight. Over time, these
changes will become routine and part of your everyday life.
  
  <br><br>
Losing just 5-10 percent of your current weight over 6 months
will lower your risk for heart disease and other conditions.

              <p><b>Stress, Depression &amp; Anxiety</b><br><br>
                                                                 
                                               Know that when it comes to Stress, Depression & Anxiety that there is no over-the-counter, miracle remedy that will work overnight. The only medicine that will
work the best is time, so give yourself a break. Here are some tips from Mental Health America:<br><br>
                
                
 <b>Learn your triggers –</b> It’s important to identify and understand what and where your stress comes from.<br><br>

<b>Know your limits –</b> Don’t take on more responsibility than you can handle right now.<br><br>
                
<b>Take things one at a time –</b> The last thing you need is to attempt to multitask. Just do one project or assignment or chore at a time. Don’t pile up all the other responsibilities in your mind.<br><br>
                
<b>Talk with someone –</b> Just being able to confide in a trusted friend, counselor or minister can help minimize and reduce your stress level.<br><br>
                
                
<b>Practice stress reduction techniques –</b> Try tensing and relaxing the muscles in your toes and progressively working your way up to your neck and head, repeat words or suggestions in your mind to relax and reduce muscle tension. Take a visual journey to a peaceful, calming place or situation. Picture yourself on a beach (if that’s what calms you) imagine the feel of sand between your toes, the sound of crashing waves, and the salty breeze.<br><br>
                
                
<b>LIVING RESOURCES PROGRAM</b><br><br>
Personal issues, planning for life events or simply managing daily life can affect your work, health and family. Your Living Resources Program provides support, resources and information for personal and work-life issues.<br><br>
                
Living Resources is company-sponsored, confidential and provided at no charge to you and your dependents. Eligible members can schedule up to 5
short-term counseling visits at no cost.

               <p><b>Preventing Colds &amp; Flu</b><br><br>
                 
Head back to school ready and prepared for Cold &amp; Flu season with these five simple tips:<br><br>

<b>Ward off Germs:</b> Germs are spread through hand-to-hand contact or when sneezed or coughed into the air. To minimize
exposure, avoid shaking hands, keep away from others who are sick and stay out of crowded rooms.<br><br>
                 
<b>Keep Hands Clean:</b> The first and easiest line of defense against the spread of germs is washing hands often. Wet, lather,
and scrub for twenty seconds. Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end, twice, to ensure the approximate
handwashing time.<br><br>
                 
<b>Eat Immune-Boosting Foods:</b>Soluble fiber—found in citrus fruits, apples, carrots, beans and oats—helps fight inflammation. Broccoli is packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as numerous antioxidants, making it one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table.<br><br>

 <b>Clear the Nose and Sinuses:</b> Germs often settle first in the nose and sinuses, so it’s important to keep nasal passages clear by either flushing them out with a saltwater solution or loosening secretions with a facial steamer or vaporizer.<br><br>
                 
<b>Stay Active:</b> Movement mobilizes the immune system. Kids who sit too much – especially indoors – get sick more often. Movement also mellows the mood, as stress depresses the immune system. Simple household chores like walking the dog or checking the mailbox can help your child stay active.<br><br>
                 
                 <b>The seasonal flu vaccine is covered at 100% (zero copay) on the State of Maine’s Point of Service health insurance plan when provided by an in-network provider. For more information contact Aetna Member Services at 1-855-850-0039.</b>
