With a new year comes a chance for new beginnings. Why not try to start the new year off right by taking the path toward better health? For instance, cut
back on salty foods, drink more water and less soda, take the stairs instead of an elevator and consistently get a good night’s sleep. Small changes can
reap big rewards. If you want to tackle bigger challenges, like losing weight, preparing for a marathon or quitting smoking, don’t feel overwhelmed. Talk
to someone, make a plan, and above all, take one day at a time. You have all year to walk down that path!<br><br>

<p><b>SLEEP BETTER</b><br><br>
  Getting a good night’s sleep on a regular basis
is key to a healthy lifestyle. It can benefit your
heart, weight, memory, mood, quality of life
and more. Studies indicate that too much or too
little sleep may even affect how long you live.<br><br>
  Tips for a restful sleep:</p>
 	<ul>
      <li>Commit to a regular nighttime schedule.</li>
      <li>Eat dinner at least two hours before bedtime;
avoid alcohol, chocolate and caffeine for
several hours beforehand as well.</li>
      <li>Say goodnight to your iPad, laptop,
smartphone and other devices at least an
hour before your bedtime.</li>
      <li>Dim the lights – harsh lighting is not conducive
to setting the sleepy mood.</li>
      <li>Turn off the TV. Read instead. (And no work
in bed!)</li>
      <li>Take a hot bath, drink a cup of warm herbal
tea, listen to soothing music or do some light
yoga poses to relax before going to bed.</li>
    </ul><br><br>

                  <b>TACKLE A BAD HABIT</b><br><br>
                  
                  Still haunted by some bad habits you haven’t
been able to shake? Overcoming a bad habit
– like being a procrastinator, eating too
much fast food, snacking when not hungry
or smoking cigarettes – will give you a great
sense of accomplishment, improve your
health and mood, and, in some cases, save you
money. If you have some small faults you’d
like to correct, don’t try to get rid of them
all at once; pick one and work on it until you
have it under control. Then, try another one
if you’d like. Especially if you’re plagued with
procrastination, don’t put off until next year
what you can do now!<br><br>
                  
                  <b>OUT WITH THE OLD, NOT SO FAST!</b><br><br>
                  
                  As we ring in 2017, take time to say goodbye
to the year we’re leaving behind. What has the
year been like for you? Experience any first
times (for instance, snorkeling, eating quinoa,
going on a cruise)? What was your single best
memory? What was your biggest challenge? Any
shoulda coulda wouldas spring to mind? How
will 2016 be remembered in your household? A
little reflection can help you decide what you
want for the new year.

              <h2><center>Stay Active In The Winter</center></h2>
              <br />
             <div class="well">
             <center><img src="../app_themes/blankcanvas/maineenews/images/winter%20activity.jpg" class="img-responsive" style=max-height:400px;></center>

 
               
             <br><br>
 <p>	
   Just because temperatures are falling and
snow may cover the ground, don’t stay inside
and hibernate. Get active! Fitness is important
to keep you healthy during the cold-weather
months. It boosts immunity, keeps off the
weight and chases away the SAD (Seasonal
Affective Disorder).<br><br>
   
   <b>TAKE A HIKE</b><br><br>
   Walking in the snow is a great cardio workout. It
gets the heart pumping and burns more calories,
because the snow makes you put in more effort
with each step you take. Add in a few hills on your
trek to really burn some calories. So, if you have
a choice between walking indoors (on a track or
treadmill) and going outside, opt for the great
outdoors. Of course, be careful where you walk,
and make sure you stretch first.<br>
   
         <div class="alert" style="color:#666666;">
         <b> Remember to dress appropriately for the
      outdoors:<br><br>
      <ul>

      <li>Wear moisture-wicking fabrics, choose footwear
      with treads, and stay away from the cotton socks,</li>

      <li>wear sunscreen if outside for
      over 10 minutes, and</li>

      <li>stay hydrated – you still sweat
      and lose water in the cold.</li>
           </ul></b>
          </div><br>
   
   <p>
   <b>HIT THE SLOPES</b><br><br>
   
   Snow-based activities, such as cross-country
skiing, downhill skiing, snowboarding and
snowshoeing, are a great way to spend the day
outside.<br><br>
   
Cross-country skiing works both your upper and
lower body. It is hard work, but worth it if you
want to burn a lot of calories. As a bonus, unlike
downhill skiing, you don’t need to travel to your
favorite ski resort to do it – your backyard or a
snow-covered park will do.<br><br>
   
Snowboarding and snowshoeing are excellent
winter fitness activities for improving balance and
endurance while providing a great cardio workout.
Both work the leg muscles (snowboarding also
works the abdominal muscles).<br>
   </p>
    <div class="alert" style="color:#666666;">
    <b>Maine offers the least crowded skiing on the
East Coast, with some of the best terrain. You
can choose from ski resorts that cater more
to families and leisure skiers, night skiing and
boarding, snow-tubing or
backcountry skiing. For travel
suggestions, visit the Maine Office
of Tourism’s website at

               </div><br>
   <p>
   <b>FIND AN ICE RINK</b><br><br>
   Don’t forget, the ice can be fun, too – lace up
the skates and go ice skating or pass out some
sticks, grab a puck and start a friendly game of
hockey. Is shuffleboard more your speed? Try its
distant cousin, curling or put together a game of
broomball – neither requires skates or skating
experience. Many indoor rinks offer skating
lessons and skate rentals, while outdoor rinks
may be equipped with warming huts, covered
skating areas and lights for night skating. If you’d
rather skip the ice, there are a few roller-skating
     rinks located throughout Maine.</p>
   
    <div class="alert" style="color:#666666;">
    <b>FUN FACT:</b> <br> Playing in the snow for 30
minutes will burn 100 to 200 calories.<br><br>
<b>NOT SO FUN FACT:</b> <br> Shoveling the
snow for 30 minutes will burn 200
      to 300 calories.

              <h2><center>Importance of Protein</center></h2>
              <br />
              <div class="well">

             <center> <img src="../app_themes/blankcanvas/maineenews/images/protein.jpg" class="img-responsive" style=max-height:400px;></center>
              <br><br>

          <p>
            Everybody needs protein. Protein is an important
component that exists naturally in every cell of the
human body. From your hair, nails and skin on the
outside of your body, to your hormones, enzymes,
tissues, blood, bones, muscles and cartilage on the
inside, protein plays many critical roles in keeping
you alive and healthy.<br><br>
Almost 20% of the human body is made up of
proteins. Continuous daily intake of protein is
essential – the dietary protein in the food we eat is
our main source of the building blocks we need to
sustain life. Because proteins are used to develop,
grow and maintain our bodies, good nutrition
(including sufficient protein intake) is essential
during pregnancy and especially important for
children and teens.
          </p><br>
                
                <p>
                  <b>PROTEIN IS A CRITICAL FOOD GROUP</b><br><br>
                  As a rule, we must consume protein in our diets.
We can use both plants and animals as a source of
dietary protein; vegetarians and meat eaters alike
can find enough protein for sustenance. Significant
amounts of protein can be found in meat, fish, eggs,
dairy products, legumes, nuts, seeds and some
vegetables.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fish, in general, has less fat than meat and
contains omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
                  <li>Remove the skin on poultry to eliminate most of
the saturated fat.</li>
                  <li>Beans (such as pinto, black, kidney and garbanzo;
also lentils and split peas) are loaded with fiber
and have more protein than any other vegetable
protein.</li>
                  <li>Nuts (and nut butter) are a great source of protein,
particularly almonds. Added bonus: Nuts are healthy sources of fat.</li>
                  <li>Whole grains such as wheat germ and quinoa have
more protein than refined or “white” food (white
bread, white rice).</li>
                  <li>Some plant-based foods (like legumes, tofu,
tempeh and other soy protein products) can
provide the same amount of protein as meats.</li>
                  <li>Use lean cuts of meat (beef or pork) and trim away
the fat.</li>
                  <li>Both egg whites and egg yolks are ideal sources
of dietary protein, but egg whites contain more
without the cholesterol (and eggs in general are
practically carbohydrate-free).</li>
                  <li>Low-fat dairy products are a good source of
protein.</li>
                  <li>Brussel sprouts, broccoli, spinach, kale,
mushrooms, asparagus and artichokes are highprotein
vegetables.</li><br><br>
                  
                  <p>
                    The type of protein you eat may factor in to weight
loss goals and your overall health. For instance,
avoid eating deli meats, hot dogs, sausages and
other processed meats – they are not a dieter’s
friend (and can be high in salt). You will probably
want to seek out alternatives to milk and other dairy
products if they cause digestive issues. And while
nuts are a healthy source of fat, keep in mind they
are also high in calories.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING…</b><br><br>
                    
                    While protein is essential for a healthy diet, eating
more protein than your body needs could cause
some health issues, like kidney stress, intestinal
irritation and dehydration. Calories from excess
protein will be converted to sugar and then to body
fat. Increased blood sugar levels from processing
excessive amounts of protein could fuel cancer cell growth. Eating too much protein with your meals could also result in a nutritional imbalance; you will need to take steps to avoid nutrient deficiencies (like eating more high-fiber complex carbohydrates in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables). On the lighter side of bad effects, too much protein might make your breath smell bad. Of course, too little protein in your diet could lead to a sluggish metabolism, weight issues, malnutrition, low energy levels and fatigue, bone and joint pain, muscle wasting or soreness and low immunity (susceptibility to infections and disease). So, balance is the key.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>DAILY PROTEIN INTAKE</b><br><br>
                    
                    The amount of protein required varies by person
and depends on overall calorie needs for your age,
sex and activity level. The daily recommended intake
of protein for healthy adults is 10% to 35% of total
daily calories from protein sources.<br><br>
                    
<b>In general, FDA recommendation is for 50 grams
of protein per day for both men and women.
Consult with your primary care physician or
nutritionist for the number that is right for your protein needs.</b><br><br>
                    
In winter, it may be tempting to overindulge during
the holidays or warm yourself up with one too
many cups of hot cocoa instead of tea, but keep in
mind that you should be following the same healthy
eating guidelines that you normally would any other
time of the year. Make sure to include lean protein,
whole grains, vegetables and fruits when planning
                  </p>
