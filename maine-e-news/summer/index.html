                <p>
                 <b>WHAT IS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE?</b><br><br>
Cardiovascular disease, such as heart
disease, is the leading cause of death
for men and women in the United
States. To understand heart disease,
we need to understand how our heart
works. Our heart needs enough blood
supply to provide oxygen to our muscles
so they can contract and pump. The
heart delivers blood to the rest of our
body through our coronary arteries.
When arteries narrow, it puts stress
on the heart muscle, making it unable
to perform at its full potential, causing
chest pain and shortness of breath.<br><br>

There are many different types of heart
disease although, the most common
heart disease in the United States is
coronary heart disease (CHD), which
can lead to a heart attack. Once the
coronary artery becomes completely
blocked, blood supply to the heart is
stopped and causes a portion of the
heart muscle to die. When this happens,
it causes a person to have a heart attack
or myocardial infarction.<br><br>

                  <b>WHAT CAUSES CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE?</b><br><br>
                  
There are some steps you can take that
could reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease. Prevention includes:
Quitting smoking. Smoking is a habit
that can be very difficult to stop. Letting
friends and family members know
you are trying to quit will help you
get through rough times. Your health
insurance plan covers up to eight (8)
tobacco cessation counseling visits (per
12 months), and the first two 90-day treatment regimens for certain
medications at no cost. You can also
talk to your doctor to find out what
alternatives there are to help you quit.<br><br>
                  
<b>Lowering cholesterol.</b> Reading the
labels on food packaging can help scale
back on high cholesterol foods. Eating
heart healthy foods, such as fish, may
help prevent high cholesterol.<br><br>

<b>Controlling high blood pressure.</b> By
reducing sodium and cutting caffeine
in your diet, you may lower high blood
pressure.<br><br>
                  
<b>Maintaining a healthy weight.</b> When
you exercise, you burn calories. Regular
physical activity will help you maintain a
healthy weight reducing your factors of
heart disease.<br><br>
                  
<b>WHAT ARE THE STATISTICS?</b><br>
According to Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention website, about 610,000
people die of heart disease in the United
States every year. That’s one in every
four deaths.<br>
• More than half of the deaths due to
heart disease in 2009 were men.<br>
• Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the
most common type of heart disease,
killing over 370,000 people annually.<br>
• Every year, 735,000 Americans have a
heart attack.

             <br><br>


             <p>Sleep plays a very important role in overall good health
throughout your life. Getting the right amount of sleep
protects your mental health, physical health and quality of
life. The way you feel throughout the day depends on the
amount of quality sleep you get. In children and young
adults, sleep helps support growth and development. Sleep
can affect how well you think, react, work, learn and interact
with others.</p><br><br>

                <p>
                  <b>How Sleep Helps</b>
                </p>
<b>Physical Health.</b> When you sleep, your body is healing to
repair your heart and blood vessels. Sleep deficiency is linked
to increased risk of heart and kidney disease and high blood
pressure. Not getting enough sleep also increases the risk of
obesity, especially in young adults.<br><br>
                
<b> Daytime Performance.</b> Your body relies on sleep. Having a
sleep deficiency will cause less productivity throughout the
day. When performing everyday tasks, such as driving or
having a conversation, a person with sleep deficiency may
think they are paying attention, but their mind actually isn’t
processing all of the information. In the case of driving, this
could not only be harmful to that person, but also to the
people around them.

             <br><br><br>

             <p>Walking is a simple exercise that offers significant benefits to our bodies. It’s known as a weight-bearing exercise because you are carrying your own body weight. Walking is a great way to improve our health because it is low impact, requires no equipment, and can be done at your own pace.<br><br>
               <b>Get Motivated, Stay Motivated</b><br><br>
               
               
              Getting motivated may be hard; staying motivated can be even harder! Walking with a group can help you stick with it for some added fun and excitement. Try walking in a scenic area that you don’t travel often. Walking only 30 minutes a day at a good pace will help improve your overall health.<br><br>
When you are on your own, use these simple adjustments to build walking into your daily routine:<br>
• Start taking the stairs instead of elevators.
• Walk your dog instead of just letting him/
her out. It will benefit both of you!
• Park farther away from the entrance when
going to work or out running errands.<br><br>
               
Use technology to get motivated! Make a playlist of your favorite songs to pass the time and keep up your pace. There are tons of apps and devices for tracking your daily steps each day. Try one out, and see how far you go. To get the most health benefit, it is recommended that you take 10,000 or more steps each day.<br><br>
Buy new apparel! Buying a new pair of sneakers or new workout outfits can motivate you to make walking a hobby. Just make sure you buy the right apparel that offers the appropriate support for walking.<br><br>
     
 <b>THERE IS NO ELEVATOR TO SUCCESS.</b> YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE STAIRS.<br><br>
Taking the stairs, instead of the elevator, can be a great workout for your lower body – in particular, your quads, hamstrings, glutes, hips, calves and feet. Taking the stairs contributes an extra 30 minutes to your total daily physical workout and burns twice as many calories as walking.

              <p>Sometimes, it can be difficult to fit physical activity into your busy schedule; however, it’s vital to your overall health. Exercising regularly can potentially decrease your risk of disease and avoid injuries and improve your physical and mental health. According to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, it is recommended that we participate in both moderate-intensity aerobic activity (like fast walking) and muscle-strengthening activities each week.<br><br>
                
<b>Try These Physical Activities This Summer!</b><br><br>
<b>1. WALKING CAN HELP PREVENT TYPE 2 DIABETES.</b> In a study from The Diabetes Prevention Program, walking 150 minutes per week and losing 7% of your body weight can reduce your risk of diabetes by 58%.<br><br>

<b>2. WALKING CAN STRENGTHEN YOUR HEART.</b> Your heart is a very strong muscle. Walking increases our heart rate which pumps blood and oxygen to our muscles, keeping it strong.<br><br>
                
<b>3. WALKING IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN.</b> Walking is a
good opportunity to let your mind wander. Meditation is the key to good mental health.<br><br>
                
<b>4. WALKING IS GOOD FOR YOUR BONES.</b> Because
walking is a weight-bearing exercise, you are
increasing the stress on your bones (especially your
hips), strengthening them.<br><br>
                
<b>5. WALKING HELPS ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS</b> OF
DEPRESSION. A person does not have to run a
marathon to alleviate symptoms of depression. A
short, simple walk daily can help ease anxiety.<br><br>
                
<b>6. WALKING MAY REDUCE RISK OF CANCER.</b> Most cancers are caused by lifestyle factors. Exercise is one of the most important actions to help guard against many types of cancer.<br><br>
                
<b>7. WALKING IMPROVES OVERALL FITNESS.</b> Walking
keeps your muscles moving, burns calories and
eases the mind! It’s a great way to cover all the bases
to improve your overall well being.

               <br><br><br>

               <p>
Drinking the recommended eight 8oz. glasses of water per day offers these benefits:<br><br>
<b> 1. Increases energy and relieves fatigue.</b> If you are not hydrated, your heart works harder, making
you feel tired.<br><br>
<b>2. Promotes weight loss.</b> Drinking water flushes the fats out of your body.<br><br>
<b>3. Flushes out toxins.</b> Water helps fight against bad toxins in your
body and boosts your immune system.<br><br>
<b>4. Improves skin complexion.</b> Water helps replenish and
hydrate the skin.<br><br>
<b>5. Maintains regularity.</b> Drinking water regulates your
metabolism and helps in digestion.<br><br>
<b>6. Natural headache remedy.</b> Headaches and cramps are a
common side effect of dehydration.<br><br>
<b>7. Prevents cramps and strains.</b> Staying properly hydrated
helps lubricate joints and muscles.<br><br>
<b>8. Puts you in a good mood.</b> If your body is hydrated, it feels
healthy and happy.<br><br>
<b>What happens when you are dehydrated?</b><br>
When your body doesn’t have enough water, you get symptoms such as tiredness, migraine, constipation, cramps, kidney problems and dry skin.<br><br>

 <p style="text-align:left;">Your primary care doctor is the best place to seek care when you are sick or injured. But what about those times you need treatment when the office is closed?<br><br>
                 
While in some cases, an emergency room visit is warranted, there are quicker and less expensive options available for getting care in non-emergency situations. Urgent care centers and walk-in clinics are convenient, cost-saving alternatives to a hospital emergency room.<br><br>
                 
<b> What's The Difference?</b><br>Many times, those with less urgent needs may have a long wait at the emergency room in order for those with more serious conditions to be treated first. At urgent care centers and walk-in clinics, patients are treated on a first-come, first-serve basis. Urgent care and walk-in clinics are also often less expensive than the emergency room, and you still receive care from a qualified health care provider.<br><br>
